      But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of <b class="t2">human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes,</b> or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely <b class ="t1"> painful. Nor again is there anyone </b>who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great <b t1>pleasure. To take a trivial</b> example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has <b t2>any right to find</b> fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?
