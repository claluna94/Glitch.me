<div>EDITED - Lorem ipsum is a pseudo-Latin text used in web design, typography, layout, and printing in place of English to emphasise design elements over content. <b>It's also called placeholder (or filler)</b> text. It's a convenient tool for mock-ups. It helps to outline the visual elements of a document or presentation, <b>eg typography, font, or layout. Lorem ipsum is mostly</b> a part of a Latin text by the classical author and philosopher Cicero. Its words and letters have been <strong>changed  changed by addition or removal, so to <b>deliberately render its content nonsensical;</b> it's not genuine, correct, or comprehensible Latin anymore. While lorem ipsum's <b>still resembles</b> classical Latin, it actually has no <meaning>meaning</meaning> whatsoever. As Cicero's text doesn't contain the letters K, W, or Z, alien to latin, these, <i>and others are often inserted</i> randomly to mimic the typographic <img> appearence of European languages, as are digraphs not to be found in the original.</div>
  
<div>sigle value
<div>Most text editors like MS Word or Lotus Notes generate random lorem text when needed, either as pre-installed module or plug-in to be added. 
  <random>does it work?</random>Word <b>a</>selection or sequence don't necessarily match the original, which is intended to add variety.
